00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
I can't stop my love my love for you

00:00:19.001 --> 00:00:23.000
We spoke toward the future

00:00:23.001 --> 00:00:29.000
Like we had a place we could go together

00:00:29.001 --> 00:00:33.000
Oh baby I can't stop my love for you

00:00:33.001 --> 00:00:36.000
I'll become your everything I believe in your promise

00:00:36.001 --> 00:00:46.000
To never let go of my hand as we walk

00:00:46.001 --> 00:00:52.000
I won't say lies like "I hate you" but

00:00:52.001 --> 00:00:59.000
For "I love you" that's never a lie isn't it?

00:00:59.001 --> 00:01:07.000
If I can't see you, if I can't be with you 
Don't you dare start getting lenient with your thoughts...

00:01:07.001 --> 00:01:13.000
Because this heart belongs to you and only you

00:01:13.001 --> 00:01:16.000
I can't stop my love for you

00:01:16.001 --> 00:01:20.000
So our love won't be torn apart, the two of us

00:01:20.001 --> 00:01:27.000
Will have to hold onto it as one
And on those nights

00:01:27.001 --> 00:01:33.000
When uncertainty visits you

00:01:34.001 --> 00:01:41.000
Take our love in your arms
And embrace it tightly
